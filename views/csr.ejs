                        a tree plantation activity was held by Varuna Team in Association with the Ahmedabad Municipal
                        Corporation on 20th august 2021. The team was composed of employees who developed and maintained
                        a greenbelt of 1000 meters at BRTS Corridor from Rabari Colony to Rajendra Park BRTS Lane.

                        for some the birth of a baby girl is marked as the arrival of Goddess Laxmi to the family
                        whereas in some cases, the arrival of a baby girl calls for mourning rather than celebration. In
                        such cases, the girls are either abandoned at birth or become prey of child marriage or else are
                        made to do household chores and are deprived of education as they feel it is not beneficial to
                        invest in a girl’s education.

                    <p>
                        La-Gajjar Machineries Pvt. Ltd., believe that education of girls is utmost important and has
                        thus adopted 100 Nanhi Kalis. As a fixed donation amount is contributed by Company and its
                        dealers in each 3rd quarter every year is utilized for education of 100 Nanhi Kalis

                        Cancer is a disease caused when a single cell in our body starts multiplying beyond control. It
                        can be completely cured with timely treatment. There are many needy cancer patients and GCS
                        helps them by providing love, care and confidence to fight for recovery. La-Gajjar Machineries
                        and our dealers donate to The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute (GCRI), an autonomous body
                        jointly managed by Government of Gujarat and Gujarat Cancer Society (GCS).

                        Cross on Friday 1st December, 2017. This unique drive gives employees a chance to volunteer for
                        something important. This appealed VARUNA employees to give a precious gift of life- The Blood!
